# ENSE 400/477 Capstone Project
Fall 2019 Semester - Winter Semester 2020
# Stride Champions (Platform Fighting Game)
Team Name:
- Super Capstone Bros

Developers:
- Jeremy Cross
- Taylen Jones

# Objective
Our goal with this project is to expand our knowledge of game design and build a small platform fighting game that takes the best element from the franchise while expanding upon them with new ideas. By the end of this project we hope to gain the knowledge to either be able to continue developing this game or be able to develop something new.

# Operating Instructions
We have provided three methods for running our game below. Hopefully methods 2 and 3 won't be nessesary, however they are there if needed.

Method 1:
Download the repository and run the executable file in the following path. The proper size of the WindowsNoEditor/ folder should be 1.83GB so if that is not the correct size of your folder then you are probably missing content. 

ENSE-400-477-Project/Unreal Project Files/Platform_Fighter/WindowsNoEditor/

There is also a quick link below that will open this location. We had to use git LFS to upload some of the executable files, however we purchased more storage and bandwidth space so this hopefully the executable works. If not then methods 2 and and 3 are below.

Method 2:
If the executabe is broken for some reason. Try this method or method 3. Download the repository. Download the newest build of unreal engine 4 (at this current time the build is 4.24). Run the game through the viewport buy pressing play in the toolbar located at the top of the screen.

Method 3
Repeat all of the steps in method 2 except instead of running it through the viewport you can package the game and run it on your own machine. To do this, go to file located in the top left hand corner and click on package project. You can then choose either windows 32 bit or windows 64 bit. Then select the location for the destination of the packaged folder. Inside this folder contains the executable of the game.

If you have any questions about running the game let us know.
