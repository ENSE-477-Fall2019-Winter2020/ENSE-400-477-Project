# ENSE 400/477 Capstone Project
Fall 2019 Semester - Winter Semester 2020
# Stride Champions (Platform Fighting Game)
Team Name:
- Super Capstone Bros

Developers:
- Jeremy Cross
- Taylen Jones

# Objective
For the ENSE 400/477 terms we were aiming to build a platform fighting game with interesting characters, stages and interactive combat between two players. With a backstory for the characters and world as well as music all within a presentable user interface.

For this project we are ultimately trying to learn and expand our knowledge of game design, and the software behind it, rather than solve a specific problem. By the end we hope to have gained the knowledge to be able to potentially continue with this project or be able to delve into other projects involving game design. 

# Operating Instructions
We have provided three methods for running our game below. Hopefully methods 2 and 3 won't be nessesary, however they are there if needed.

Method 1:
Download the repository and run the executable file in the following path. The proper size of the WindowsNoEditor/ folder should be 1.83GB so if that is not the correct size of your folder then you are probably missing content. 

ENSE-400-477-Project/Unreal Project Files/Platform_Fighter/WindowsNoEditor/

There is also a quick link below that will open this location. We had to use git LFS to upload some of the executable files, however we purchased more storage and bandwidth space so this hopefully the executable works. If not then methods 2 and and 3 are below.

Method 2:
If the executabe is broken for some reason. Try this method or method 3. Download the repository. Download the newest build of unreal engine 4 (at this current time the build is 4.24). Run the game through the viewport buy pressing play in the toolbar located at the top of the screen.

Method 3
Repeat all of the steps in method 2 except instead of running it through the viewport you can package the game and run it on your own machine. To do this, go to file located in the top left hand corner and click on package project. You can then choose either windows 32 bit or windows 64 bit. Then select the location for the destination of the packaged folder. Inside this folder contains the executable of the game.

If you have any questions about running the game let us know.

# Known Issues

Issue 1:
Player one's attack animation, sound effect, particle effect and knockback trigger even outside of collision range.

Issue 2:
If players are playing the same character, player one's health value does not reset properly.

Issue 3:
adding sphere collisions to the characters have made the platform logic buggy on the Cosmic Rift Stage. Players no longer transition smoothly while navigating the platforms.

For the best experience we recomend that both players play different characters.
